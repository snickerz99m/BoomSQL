# Session Initialization Fix Summary

## Problem
The BoomSQL application was failing with "no running event loop" errors when creating instances of:
- `SqlInjectionEngine`
- `WebCrawler`
- `DorkSearcher`

This occurred because these classes were trying to create `aiohttp.TCPConnector` objects in their `__init__` methods, but there was no event loop running at initialization time.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the constructor pattern where aiohttp session objects were being created immediately during object instantiation:

```python
def __init__(self, config):
    # ... other initialization
    self.init_session()  # This failed with "no running event loop"

def init_session(self):
    connector = aiohttp.TCPConnector(...)  # Requires event loop
    self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession(...)
```

## Solution
Implemented lazy session initialization that defers aiohttp session creation until an event loop is available:

### 1. Modified Initialization
Changed from eager to lazy initialization:
```python
def __init__(self, config):
    # ... other initialization
    # Initialize session variables (but don't create session yet)
    self.session = None
    self._session_initialized = False
```

### 2. Updated init_session Method
Added event loop detection and error handling:
```python
def init_session(self):
    """Initialize aiohttp session (only when event loop is running)"""
    if self._session_initialized:
        return
        
    try:
        # Check if we have a running event loop
        loop = None
        try:
            loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        except RuntimeError:
            # No running loop, we'll create session later when needed
            return
            
        # Create session only if event loop is running
        connector = aiohttp.TCPConnector(...)
        self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession(...)
        self._session_initialized = True
        
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Failed to initialize session: {e}")
        self._session_initialized = True  # Mark as initialized to avoid retries
```

### 3. Added Session Checks
Added session initialization and null checks to all methods that use sessions:
```python
async def some_method(self):
    # Ensure session is initialized
    self.init_session()
    
    # If session is still None, handle gracefully
    if self.session is None:
        self.log_warning("Session not available, skipping operation")
        return default_value
    
    # Use session normally
    async with self.session.get(url) as response:
        ...
```

### 4. Enhanced Close Method
Updated session cleanup to reset state:
```python
async def close(self):
    """Close the session"""
    if self.session:
        await self.session.close()
        self.session = None
        self._session_initialized = False
```

## Files Modified
- `core/sql_injection_engine.py`
- `core/web_crawler.py`
- `core/dork_searcher.py`

## Testing
- ✅ All core functionality tests pass
- ✅ Session initialization works correctly in async context
- ✅ No "no running event loop" errors
- ✅ Graceful handling when sessions cannot be created
- ✅ Proper cleanup and state management

## Result
The fix successfully resolves the async event loop issues while maintaining backward compatibility and adding robust error handling. The application now works correctly in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts.
