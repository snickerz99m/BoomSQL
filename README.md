## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

#### MSBuild Not Found
**Error**: `'msbuild' is not recognized as an internal or external command`

**Solutions**:
1. Use Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio
2. Add MSBuild to PATH: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools\MSBuild\Current\Bin`
3. Install Visual Studio Build Tools
4. Use full path: `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe"`

#### Missing Dependencies
**Error**: `Could not load file or assembly 'ChilkatDotNet46'` or similar

**Solutions**:
1. Obtain the required DLL files from their respective vendors
2. Update project references to point to correct paths
3. Consider using NuGet packages if available
4. Check if evaluation/trial versions are available

#### Missing Braces Error
**Error**: `Unexpected character '{'` or similar parsing errors
